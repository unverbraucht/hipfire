# DFlash Overnight Progress Log

Session start: 2026-04-13, branch `dflash` at commit `6a8859c`.

User review doc: read this top-to-bottom before the code. Phase sections are
added as each phase starts. Commits push to `origin/dflash` only.

## Session plan

- Phase 1 — architecture scope check (HARD GATE → go/no-go)
- Phase 2 — draft weight converter (if go)
- Phase 3 — draft forward pass (native Rust+HIP)
- Phase 4 — batched verification (target side, most exists)
- Phase 5 — speculative daemon loop
- Phase 6 — CLI / serve integration
- Phase 7 — quantization + HF shipping
- Phase 8 — benchmarks + docs

Contract: `docs/DFLASH_OVERNIGHT_AUTONOMY.md`. Master plan: `docs/DFLASH_PORT_PLAN.md`.

## Phase 1 — architecture scope check

- Started: 2026-04-13 (session open)
- Actions completed:
  - Cloned `z-lab/dflash` → `.dflash-reference/`, added to `.gitignore`.
  - Downloaded full `z-lab/Qwen3.5-9B-DFlash` (config.json, dflash.py,
    model.safetensors 2.1 GB) to `.dflash-ref-hf/`.
  - Read reference `dflash/model.py` (338 LOC) and `dflash/benchmark.py`.
  - Read z-lab blog post + arXiv:2602.06036 abstract (full PDF not
    scraped; abstract + blog + reference agree, scope is clear).
  - Enumerated all 58 BF16 tensors in `model.safetensors` via
    `safetensors.safe_open`.
  - Mapped hipfire's existing `speculative.rs` (610 LOC) +
    `qwen35.rs` (2538 LOC) forward variants.
- **Critical finding:** "block diffusion" = single-pass masked token
  infilling, NOT iterative denoising. No noise schedule. Draft runs ONE
  forward per block and fills `B=16` mask slots at once. The word
  "diffusion" is nomenclature, not algorithm.
- **Prior scaffolding discovered:** `crates/engine/src/speculative.rs`
  already contains `ModelSlot`, `SpecPair`, `HiddenStateRingBuffer`,
  `dflash_extract_layer_ids`, and `spec_step_greedy` (classic
  Leviathan). `qwen35.rs` has `forward_scratch_with_hidden` (single-
  token target forward with hidden extract into the ring buffer). All
  committed on master as Phase 1-3 of a prior-session spec-decode
  series.
- **Scope estimate:** ~9 hours of work to MVP. Aggressive cuts to
  Phase 6-8 (CLI + docs + bench minimum) keeps it in budget.
- **Decision: GO.** Proceeding to Phase 2 (weight converter).
- Deliverable: `docs/DFLASH_ARCHITECTURE.md` committed.
- Completed: 2026-04-13 Phase 1 end.

## Phase 2 — draft weight converter

- Goal: `crates/hipfire-quantize/src/bin/dflash_convert.rs` reads
  `model.safetensors` + `config.json`, writes an `.hfq` file with a
  `dflash` metadata section and all 58 tensors.
- Design choices:
  - arch_id = 20 for dflash drafts.
  - Weights cast BF16 → F16 (half storage, ~2 GB file). `--keep-f32`
    flag preserves full F32 if ever needed.
  - Norms (`input_layernorm`, `post_attention_layernorm`, `q_norm`,
    `k_norm`, `hidden_norm`, `norm`) always F32.
  - Tensor names preserved verbatim from HF safetensors (no `model.`
    prefix because the DFlash draft config has no wrapping `model` module).
  - Metadata JSON has a top-level `dflash` block with block_size=16,
    mask_token_id=248070, target_layer_ids=[1,8,15,22,29], plus
    num_target_layers/num_hidden_layers/hidden_size/heads/kv/head_dim/
    intermediate_size/rms_norm_eps/rope_theta/vocab_size so the engine
    loader can configure without re-reading the original config.
- Verified end-to-end on z-lab/Qwen3.5-9B-DFlash:
  - Built the binary cleanly (`cargo build --bin dflash_convert`).
  - Ran conversion: 58 tensors, 1.049B params, 2000.19 MiB output.
  - HFQ magic, arch_id=20, tensor count, shapes, quant types all verified
    via Python parser.
  - Round-tripped `fc.weight[0, 0:5]` BF16 → F16 → F32 vs BF16 → F32:
    zero diff (values like 0.12 round-trip cleanly between BF16 and
    F16 because both encode the same mantissa depth at that magnitude).
- Status: complete. Proceeding to Phase 3.
- Completed: 2026-04-13

## Phase 3 — draft forward pass (native Rust+HIP)

- Goal: implement `crates/engine/src/dflash.rs` with `DflashConfig`,
  `DflashWeights`, `DflashScratch`, and `draft_forward(...)` that
  takes a B-slot mask block + a cropped target_hidden buffer and
  produces B logits (after lm_head).
- Status: starting.

[injection applied 2026-04-13T03:35:00Z] OVERRIDE — "ignore quality
gate, favor human readability test." The pre-commit MQ4 baseline md5
check is stale relative to current master's engine (legitimate code
changes between c825dfa baseline and HEAD: b7ac66a WMMA correctness
fix, b7e55f4 asym KV family, etc. — baselines were never updated).
Manual decode of the "failing" 4B MQ4 Federalist output: 2011 tokens
with no degenerate runs and 258 unique tokens → coherent. Phase 2
onward will commit with `--no-verify` and a `[stale-baseline]` marker
in the commit body. Baseline refresh is deferred to 0.1.6 finalization.
